# 📜 Chrome Extension Privacy Policy

Effective Date: January 8, 2026

I respect and value your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how I handle and protect your personal information in relation to your use of my Google Chrome extension(s), including any permissions requested, how data is used, and how it is stored or shared.

# 🧾 Information Collection and Use

My Google Chrome extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information that can be used to personally identify you, such as your name, email address, location, or other private data.

However, the extension may request certain browser permissions in order to provide its functionality. These permissions are used only as described below and are not used to collect personal information.

# 📌 Permissions and API Usage

The extension may request the following permissions:

🔹 chrome.tabs / activeTab

Used to access the currently active tab in order to capture screenshots or perform user-requested actions. This access is only used when explicitly triggered by the user.

🔹 chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab

Used to capture a screenshot of the current tab when the user chooses to create or upload a screenshot.

🔹 chrome.storage

Used to store user preferences or settings locally within your browser. No personal information is uploaded or shared with any server.

Note:
None of the captured screenshots, browsing data, or stored settings are automatically transmitted to any remote server or third party unless the user explicitly chooses to upload or share them.

# 📸 Screenshot Handling

This extension provides an optional screenshot capture functionality.

When you initiate a screenshot:

The screenshot is generated locally within your Chrome browser.

It is not automatically sent to any remote server.

It remains on your device until you decide to save, upload, or share it yourself.

This extension does not monitor your browsing activity in the background.

# 🔗 Links to Other Websites

My Google Chrome extension may contain links to other websites not operated by me. This Privacy Policy does not cover how those websites process personal information. I encourage you to review the Privacy Policy of every website that you visit.

# 📊 Data Disclosure

Since no personal data is collected, stored, or transmitted by default:

Your data is not sold to third parties

Your usage behavior is not shared with advertisers

No analytics tracking scripts are embedded

No third-party servers receive your data

# 📜 Changes to this Privacy Policy

I reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised Privacy Policy, and the “Effective Date” above will be updated. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
